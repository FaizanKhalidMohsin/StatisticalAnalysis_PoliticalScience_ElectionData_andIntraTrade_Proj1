## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
require(dplyr)

data.intrade=read.csv("intrade08.csv")
str(data.intrade)

data.intrade$p_Dem = data.intrade$PriceD/100

data.intrade$p_Rep = data.intrade$PriceR/100

Nov2008 = subset(data.intrade, day == "2008-11-04")

EV = data.pres$EV
Nov2008 = cbind(Nov8, EV) 

expected = Nov2008$p_Dem * Nov2008$EV
sum(expected)


abline(v=mg,col="red")

EV_each_state=rep(0, 51)

for (i in 1:51){

  EV_each_state[i]=sample(Nov2008$EV[i], 1, prob = Nov2008$p_Dem)

}

?rbinom

rbinom()
data.pres=read.csv("pres08.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
